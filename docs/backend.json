    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to address the 'auth/unauthorized-domain' error and support the application's data storage needs, focusing on security, scalability, and ease of debugging.  The core structure is path-based ownership for user data, and all collections have homogeneous security postures.\n\nThe structure enforces Authorization Independence by avoiding `get()` calls in security rules. All authorization information is derived from `request.auth.uid` and the document path.  The application only uses authenticated users, and relies on ownership, and segregated collections to enforce security.\n\nCollection segregation is used extensively. User-owned data is stored under `/users/{userId}` to ensure that each user only has access to their own data. There are no global roles or custom claims.\n\nThe structure supports secure `list` operations (QAPs) by restricting access based on path-based ownership. A user can only list knowledge entries in their own collection.\n\nOwnership and timestamps are maintained and can be used to enforce invariants, ensuring data integrity."
